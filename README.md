# Social Network API
This api was created to allow users of a social network to create thoughts which can be reacted to by other users. 

## Usage 
Npm start should start server, then CRUD ops can be validated w Insomnia

Currently getting an ECONNREFUSED error related to address in config/connection.js - error is in MongooseServerSelection function in the node_modules code for mongoose, frankly a bit confused.

Uninstalled and reinstalled mongoose to try to fix and updated dependencies to match CLI responses for versions.
